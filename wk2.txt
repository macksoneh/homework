HI Mack,

Thanks a lot for creating the list.  I added some detail below.

For those students have ZERO linux background, you may skip these homeworks.  (You may choose this course for credit option.) 

Please review those students projects from last section, please bring project questions to class?  Up to 3 students can form as group to finish your class project. 

Thanks,

Shengliang Song

I mean "gcc-arm-none-eabi" gcc.

% which gcc-arm-none-eabi-gcc

If you do not have them, you need follow the following step to install them.

https://launchpad.net/~terry.guo/+archive/gcc-arm-embedded

Here are quick steps to install toolchain from this PPA:

Step1: Inside Ubuntu, open a terminal and input
       "sudo add-apt-repository ppa:terry.guo/gcc-arm-embedded"

Step2: Continue to input
       "sudo apt-get update"

Step3: Continue to input to install toolchain
       "sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-none-eabi"

To remove installed toolchain, just input "sudo apt-get remove gcc-arm-none-eabi".
To update the toolchain, just repeat above step2 and step3.

Do I need to install gcc? I thought Ubuntu 12.04 LTS comes with gcc C compiler.

Thanks,
